Your job is to return me a list of user stories, selected from given list, that are the best to take in new sprint. 
The sprint is scheduled to continue {{sprint_weeks_count}} weeks.
There can be any number of user stories. Select as many as possible but at most {{user_stories_count}}.

Your answer should be highly relevant according to product vision, to sprint duration, to importance and estimation of user stories.

Make sure that:
1. Each selected user story is from provided list.

3. You should stop selecting user stories when you think that it is enough for one sprint
4. List of selected user stories after completion must add a value for customer of product under development
